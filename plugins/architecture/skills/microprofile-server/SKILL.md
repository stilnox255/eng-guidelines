description: Architecture and coding rules for long-running Java MicroProfile / Jakarta EE server applications — Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters), one class per use case, business components (BC), JAX-RS adapters, CDI, JSON-P, testing (unit/integration/system), and gradle project structure. Use when creating, generating, scaffolding, writing, or reviewing code, resources, domain types, use cases, or business components in MicroProfile server projects. Not for serverless deployments.

## Related Skills
- consult the `quarkus` skill for framework-specific guidance: REST, CDI/ArC, Hibernate ORM, Panache, configuration, OpenAPI, messaging, security (OIDC/JWT), observability, native/packaging, and tooling
- consult the `quarkus-panache-smells` skill when writing or reviewing PanacheRepository code: N+1 queries, missing projections, pagination, eager fetching, unclosed streams
- apply both alongside the rules below; on conflict, the project rules in this skill take precedence

## Java Version & Syntax
- use Java 25 with modern syntax (var, pattern matching, records, text blocks)
- prefer dependencies in this order: Java SE, MicroProfile, Jakarta EE
- never add a dependency that is added transitively by another dependency
- use Java SE APIs over writing custom code
- prefer the most specific Java SE type for the domain
- prefer unchecked over checked exceptions; never throw generic exceptions like java.lang.Exception
- throw RuntimeException subclasses, not directly; inherit from WebApplicationException in JAX-RS projects
- consider using Java records instead of classes with final fields
- prefer factory methods in records over passing null in constructors
- always use OffsetDateTime instead of LocalDateTime for time zone awareness unless explicitly required

## Logging
- use org.jboss.logging.Logger instead of System.out statements
- never use java.util.logging.Logger or java.lang.System.Logger
- Logger fields must be named LOGGER (uppercase) and marked as static final, created via `Logger.getLogger(SomeClass.class)`

## Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- structure code using Hexagonal Architecture with one class per use case in the application layer
- top level package reflects the application responsibility or name; business components (BC) are children of the top level package, named after their responsibilities
- per-BC package layout: `[ORG].[PROJECT].[BC].{domain | application | adapter.in | adapter.out}`
- cross-cutting primitives (page records, upload records, error types, shared value objects) live in `[ORG].[PROJECT].shared.kernel` — never inside a BC
- one BC may depend on another only through `{otherBc}.application.port.in` (published `*UseCase`/`*QueryPort` interface) — never on `{otherBc}.adapter.*`, `{otherBc}.application.usecase.*`, or `{otherBc}.domain.*` directly; every use case publishes a port.in interface, no exceptions
- do not explain the hexagonal pattern in documentation; link to the project ADR instead

## ArchUnit-Enforced Rules
Rules below are compiler/test-enforced by `HexagonalArchitectureTest` (`src/test/java/de/ingoschindler/architecture/`) — violating them fails the build, not just review. Naming-convention rules elsewhere in this document (UseCase/Service/Repository/Port/Command/Result suffixes) are convention only, not machine-checked.

- core (`domain`/`application`) never depends on `jakarta.ws.rs`, RESTEasy, `jakarta.persistence`, Hibernate, Panache, or MP OpenAPI (`coreIsFrameworkFree`)
- an adapter never depends on another BC's `domain` (`adaptersDoNotDependOnAnotherBcsDomain`); a BC's `domain` never depends on another BC's `domain` (`busBccDomainsDoNotDependOnOtherBccDomains`)
- `adapter.in` never depends on `application.usecase` — inbound adapters call the `*UseCase`/`*QueryPort` interface, never the concrete `*Service`/`*Query` class, even within the same BC (`inboundAdaptersOnlyAccessPortsNotUseCases`)
- `adapter.in` never depends on `adapter.out.persistence` (`inboundAdaptersDoNotDependOnPersistenceAdapter`)
- `@Entity` classes live only in `adapter.out.persistence` (`jpaEntitiesLiveOnlyInPersistenceAdapter`); so does anything extending `PanacheEntity`/`PanacheEntityBase` (`panacheEntityBaseLivesOnlyInPersistenceAdapter`) or depending on `PanacheQuery` (`panacheQueryStaysInPersistenceAndSanctionedBridges`)
- `application` never depends on RESTEasy's multipart `FileUpload` (`uploadedFileNotJaxRsFileUploadInApplication`)
- `adapter.out` never depends on another BC's `adapter.out` (`adapterOutDoesNotDependOnAnotherBcsAdapterOut`)
- no `boundary`/`control`/`entity` packages remain anywhere (`noLegacyBceLayersRemain`)

## Domain Layer (`{bc}.domain`)
- POJOs carrying business logic (Rich Domain Model, not anemic/Active Record): entities carry business calculations, state transitions, and invariant checks; "POJO" means free of framework coupling, not free of behavior
- no imports from `jakarta.persistence`, `jakarta.ws.rs`, `io.quarkus.*`, `org.jboss.resteasy.*`, MapStruct, or any adapter package (`coreIsFrameworkFree`)
- no `@Inject`, no `@Entity`, no `@Schema`, no `@JsonbProperty`, no `@RestForm`
- external data required by a domain method is passed as a method parameter; never inject infrastructure into a domain class
- model value objects as records; model finite sets as enums
- never `extends PanacheEntity` / `PanacheEntityBase` — that's an adapter-layer concern (`panacheEntityBaseLivesOnlyInPersistenceAdapter`)

## Application Layer (`{bc}.application`)
- every use case is a pair: a `{Verb}{Noun}UseCase` (single-action) or `{Noun}QueryPort` (multi-method read facade) interface under `{bc}.application.port.in`, implemented by exactly one `{Verb}{Noun}Service` / `{Noun}Query` class under `{bc}.application.usecase` — always, not only when another BC needs it; inbound adapters (including this BC's own) may only depend on the port.in interface, never the concrete class (`inboundAdaptersOnlyAccessPortsNotUseCases`)
- input as a `Command` record (`{Verb}{Noun}Command`) when the use case takes more than one or two primitives, or the parameter set is likely to grow; plain method parameters (e.g. `execute(UUID id)`) are fine for simple single/two-argument lookups — don't wrap a trivial parameter list in a `Command` for its own sake
- `Command`/`Result` records live in `{bc}.application.port.in`, next to the interface they belong to — not in `application.usecase`
- output as a `Result` record (`{Verb}{Noun}Result`) or a domain type directly when no shape transformation is needed
- use case method signature: `Result execute(Command cmd)` (or a domain-type return, or a plain-parameter signature per above)
- use cases depend on out-ports (`{bc}.application.port.out.*`) and domain types; never on adapter classes, JAX-RS, JPA, or REST DTOs
- `@Transactional` is allowed here when the use case writes through a repository
- `@ApplicationScoped` beans for use cases — the only CDI scope used in this codebase; these beans are stateless (no mutable instance fields), so the client-proxy singleton introduces no contention; no field injection — declare ports as fields and let CDI inject

## Adapter Layer (`{bc}.adapter`)
- `adapter.in.rest` — JAX-RS resources; resources are thin and delegate to a use case
- `adapter.in.rest.dto` — request/response records, optional `*Mapper` to/from domain types; mapping between the adapter's external representation and the domain types spoken by the port belongs here, not in `application.port.*` (which is interfaces only, no implementation)
- `adapter.in.scheduled` — `@Scheduled` jobs only; thin, delegate to a use case
- `adapter.in.messaging` — `@ConsumeEvent` handlers only; thin, delegate to a use case
- `adapter.out.persistence` — JPA entity (`{Aggregate}JpaEntity`), Panache repository implementation (`Jpa{Aggregate}Repository implements {Aggregate}Repository`), persistence mapper
- `adapter.out.{external}` — external-system adapters (object storage, HTTP APIs, message brokers, identity providers) implementing an out-port
- `extends PanacheEntity` / `extends PanacheEntityBase` is forbidden outside `adapter.out.persistence` (`panacheEntityBaseLivesOnlyInPersistenceAdapter`)

## Package Naming
- create application level package with name derived from gradle project or context
- name packages after their domain responsibilities
- create package-info.java for top level packages with JavaDoc documenting design decisions and responsibilities (not contents)
- document only domain-specific packages with package-info.java where the purpose is not self-evident

## Inbound Adapters (`adapter.in.*`)
- JAX-RS resources contain no business logic; they translate HTTP to a use-case `Command`, invoke `useCase.execute(cmd)`, translate the result back to HTTP
- health checks live here (`adapter.in.health` or alongside the resource)
- `@ConsumeEvent` handlers stay thin: receive event, build a `Command`, delegate to a use case, return
- scheduled jobs (`@Scheduled`) stay thin: build a `Command`, delegate to a use case
- prefer ApplicationScoped beans; no `@Transactional` on inbound adapters — transactional boundaries belong to the use case

## Out-Ports (`{bc}.application.port.out.*`)
- one out-port interface per external concern (`{Aggregate}Repository`, `{External}Gateway`, `{External}Client`)
- methods speak in domain types and primitives; never in JPA, JAX-RS, or adapter-specific types
- a port may return a domain type, a `shared.kernel.Page<T>` of domain types, a domain `Optional`, or a small port-local record for infra-shaped results (e.g. a detection-result record) that isn't itself a domain aggregate
- returning domain types is intentional, not a leak: the adapter implementing the port is responsible for translating the infra-specific representation (JPA entity, HTTP response, vendor SDK object) into the domain type before it crosses the port boundary
- never expose `PanacheQuery<>`, `Stream<JpaEntity>`, `Response`, `FileUpload`, or vendor SDK types through a port (`panacheQueryStaysInPersistenceAndSanctionedBridges`)

## Persistence Adapter (`{bc}.adapter.out.persistence`)
- the JPA-bound class is `{Aggregate}JpaEntity` and lives only in this package (`jpaEntitiesLiveOnlyInPersistenceAdapter`)
- `Jpa{Aggregate}Repository implements {bc}.application.port.out.{Aggregate}Repository` is the only place that talks to Panache / `EntityManager`
- a `{Aggregate}PersistenceMapper` translates between the JPA entity and the domain POJO — hand-rolled today across this codebase (MapStruct is a declared but currently unused dependency; do not introduce it without discussion)
- the JPA entity's shape does not need to mirror the domain object 1:1 — that's what the ORM is for: map between the storage-efficient shape and the domain-efficient shape; denormalize a cross-BC reference as scalar snapshot columns (e.g. `{ref}Id`, `{ref}Name`) instead of a JPA association across BC boundaries, since `adapter.out` may never depend on another BC's `adapter.out` (`adapterOutDoesNotDependOnAnotherBcsAdapterOut`)
- JPA `@OneToMany` / `@ManyToOne` graphs within the same BC's aggregate are an implementation detail of the persistence adapter; the domain models its aggregate relationships in its own terms
- do not return JPA entities from repository methods; return domain types

## Class Naming Conventions
- name classes after their responsibilities
- avoid meaningless suffixes: *Impl, *Manager, *Creator
- class names must not end with "Control" (legacy BCE vocabulary)
- use "UseCase" suffix only for the port.in interface of a single-action use case (`UploadModelUseCase`); use "Service" suffix only for the class implementing it (`UploadModelService`) — "Service" is not a general-purpose suffix, it is reserved for this one role
- multi-method read facades (several finder methods, no `Command`/`Result` envelope) are not a `*UseCase` — use "QueryPort" for the port.in interface (`AnnotationExportQueryPort`) and "Query" (no further suffix) for the implementing class (`AnnotationExportQuery`)
- use "Command" / "Result" suffixes for use-case input/output records
- use "Repository" suffix for out-port repositories; persistence-adapter implementations are named `Jpa{Aggregate}Repository`
- use "Port" suffix for non-repository out-ports (`ObjectStoragePort`, `DownloadTokenPort`)
- only use "Resource" suffix for JAX-RS classes
- only use "Factory" suffix for actual GoF Factory pattern
- only use "Builder" suffix for classes with typical builder structure (method chaining)
- JPA-bound classes carry the "JpaEntity" suffix (`ModelJpaEntity`) and live only in `adapter.out.persistence`

## Visibility & Modifiers
- avoid private visibility; prefer package-private (default) visibility
- avoid "private static" methods; prefer default visibility
- do not use final for fields (exception: static final for LOGGER)
- do not use constructor injection

## Interfaces & Classes
- only use interfaces with multiple implementations or for strategy pattern — **exception: hexagonal port interfaces** (`*UseCase`/`*QueryPort`/`*Repository`/`*Port` under `application.port.*`, or a shared-kernel port like `ObjectStoragePort`) are single-impl by design; that's the point of Ports & Adapters, and ArchUnit enforces the split (`inboundAdaptersOnlyAccessPortsNotUseCases`). MicroProfile Rest Client interfaces (`@RegisterRestClient`) are exempt too — there's no hand-written implementation, the proxy is generated at runtime. This rule targets accidental interface+Impl boilerplate elsewhere, not these patterns
- do not create interfaces with abstract methods implemented by a single class; use classes directly (same port-pattern exception applies)
- create multiple classes only if it decreases complexity and increases readability

## Method Naming & Design
- avoid "getter" methods starting with "get"; prefer record convention (e.g., configuration() not getConfiguration())
- keep methods short and testable
- create well-named methods for coarse-grained, cohesive, self-contained logic
- if a lambda requires multiple statements or braces {}, extract it into a well-named helper method
- do not create multiline lambda expressions; use method references instead
- prefer extracting inline predicates into explaining methods and use method references (e.g., `.filter(this::isSkillFile)` over `.filter(p -> p.endsWith("SKILL.md"))`)
- extract repeated calculations or string concatenations into helper methods (DRY); apply **Rule of Three** — refactor on the third occurrence, not the second (avoid premature abstraction)
- do not create empty delegates which just call methods without added value

## Stream & Collections
- prefer java.util.stream.Stream API over for loops
- avoid forEach; prefer Stream methods
- prefer Stream.of to Arrays.stream
- prefer toList() to .collect(Collectors.toList())
- prefer List.of over String[] or new ArrayList<>()
- avoid creating unnecessary intermediate collections when streaming arrays
- prefer variable declaration over lengthy method chaining

## Code Style
- prefer multiple simpler lines to one more complex line
- prefer multiline Strings (text blocks) over String concatenations
- prefer imports over fully qualified class names
- use "this" to reference instance fields
- remove unused imports
- extract variables to eliminate duplication
- prefer enums over plain Strings for finite, well-defined values
- reuse enum constants as values if possible; enum constants do not have to follow naming conventions
- prefer try-with-resources over explicitly closing resources

## Simplicity Principles
- keep the design KISS and YAGNI
- always implement the simplest possible solution
- write simple code first; ask before implementing enhancements or optional features
- never over-engineer; ask about adding optional features or extension points
- create new components with minimal business logic and essential fields only

## Exceptions
- create custom exceptions only if it significantly improves robustness or maintainability
- domain exceptions extend `RuntimeException`, never `WebApplicationException` — `WebApplicationException` is a `jakarta.ws.rs` type, banned from `domain` by `coreIsFrameworkFree`; a dedicated `{Name}ExceptionMapper` in `adapter.in.rest.exception` translates each domain exception to a `Response` — see REST Exception Mapper Logging below for the full convention
- do not re-throw exceptions with "throw e" without adding value

## REST Exception Mapper Logging
Every JAX-RS `ExceptionMapper` emits exactly one log line per request handled. Severity is chosen by the operational nature of the failure, not by the HTTP status. An error log that fills with normal client traffic is an error log nobody reads — the one entry that mattered during an incident gets lost in it. Record adopting this convention as your own project's ADR; the convention itself:

| Bucket | When to use | Typical HTTP statuses |
|---|---|---|
| **DEBUG** | Pure client errors — malformed request, missing resource, static-input contract violation (`*NotFound`, `ConstraintViolation`, malformed JSON, unknown enums). Frequent, not actionable for operators. | 400, 404 |
| **INFO**  | State-conflict errors — request well-formed but system state legitimately rejected it (active model cannot be deleted, analysis already running, illegal status transition). | 400, 409, 422 |
| **WARN**  | Operational / dependency-state failures — something the service depends on is unhealthy, missing, or unconfigured (a dependency is unreachable, unconfigured, or has no capacity). Operator must see these. | 502, 503 |
| **ERROR** | Unhandled exceptions and infrastructure faults — already covered by `GlobalExceptionMapper` and `DatabaseExceptionMapper`. | 500 |

**Stacktrace policy:** WARN and ERROR mappers pass the throwable as the last logger argument (stacktrace logged). DEBUG and INFO mappers log the message + key fields only — no stacktrace; the exception class name in the message is sufficient context for expected control-flow failures.

**Format:** one line, message + `key=value` pairs. Key fields are the exception's own identifiers (resource id, role, dataset id) — never the full request body, never secrets.

**Pattern** (one `LOGGER` field per mapper class, one `LOGGER.log(...)` call before building the `Response`):

```java
@Provider
public class SomeExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<SomeException> {

    static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(SomeExceptionMapper.class);

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(SomeException exception) {
        LOGGER.infof("SomeFailure id=%s", exception.getId());
        return Response.status(...).type("application/problem+json").entity(...).build();
    }
}
```

When introducing a new mapper, assign it to the right bucket via the severity buckets above and follow the policy above.

## JavaDoc
- do not write obvious JavaDoc comments that rephrase code
- document the intentions and the "why", not implementation details
- either describe the "why" or do not comment at all
- follow links in JavaDoc to external specifications and use them for code generation
- use popular, also funny, technical terms from the Java SE, MicroProfile and Jakarta EE ecosystems as examples in unit tests and javadoc

## README Guidelines
- write brief, 'to the point' README.md files for advanced developers
- use precise and concise language; avoid generic adjectives like "simple", "lightweight"
- do not include detailed project structure (file/folder listings); high-level module descriptions are acceptable
- never list REST resources in READMEs
- if modules are listed, provide links
- do not use "Orchestrates" term; use more specific alternatives

## Test-Driven Development
- write the test first, then the implementation — TDD is the default workflow
- the test encodes the expected behavior; the implementation makes it pass
- for prototyping and exploration, use the `/prototype` skill instead
- **Red means the test runs and fails on an assertion, not a compile error.** Production code under test must compile — create the minimal stub (class/method signature) the test needs first, then write the test against it. A commit that fails `compileTestJava` is not a valid red commit here: `.githooks/pre-commit` runs `checkstyleTest`, which transitively depends on `compileTestJava` succeeding, so a non-compiling commit is rejected before it can land. Established convention in this repo's history (e.g. 3afc8b38, 38f7c216): the red commit contains a class that compiles but is intentionally incomplete/wrong, so the test fails on assertion.

## Testing Strategy — Three Layers
- **Domain Unit Tests** (`{bc}.domain.*`): test calculations, state transitions, and invariants on the domain POJOs with plain JUnit, no Quarkus runtime, no mocks. Primary home for rich-domain logic tests.
- **Use Case Unit Tests** (`{bc}.application.usecase.*`): plain JUnit + Mockito with mocked out-ports (repositories, gateways), no Quarkus runtime. One test per use-case class covering the orchestration logic.
- **Inbound Adapter Integration Tests** (`{bc}.adapter.in.rest.*`): `@QuarkusTest` + RestAssured with `@InjectMock` on the use case. Test HTTP routing, authorization (`@TestSecurity`), input validation, serialization, and error responses. These verify the API contract.
- **Persistence Adapter Tests** (`{bc}.adapter.out.persistence.*`): `@QuarkusTest` with a real database. Test repository queries, mappers, and transactional behavior. Use `*DbTest` suffix to distinguish from pure unit tests.

## Testing Rules
- unit test methods must not start with "test" or "should"
- avoid writing repetitive or trivial unit tests; keep only essential tests verifying core functionality
- do not write tests for implementations that cannot fail (enums, records, getters/setters)
- create minimalistic tests first
- three tests per class is a starting ceiling for Domain/Use Case unit tests, not a hard cap — don't pad to reach it, and don't split a cohesive Inbound Adapter IT, Persistence `*DbTest`, or fitness-function suite (e.g. one ArchUnit rule per method) just to stay under it
- do not use private visibility in tests

## System Tests (ST)
Not active in this project today — `settings.gradle` defines a single module, no `-st` module exists. The `*IT` classes here (e.g. `DatasetsResourceCrudIT`) are Inbound Adapter Integration Tests per the Testing Strategy above (`@QuarkusTest` + RestAssured, in-module) — a different thing from what this section describes. Apply the rules below only if a genuine multi-module, externally-deployed cross-service test suite gets introduced.

- system tests are created in a dedicated gradle module ending with "-st"
- use microprofile-rest-client for testing JAX-RS resources
- REST client interfaces: src/main/java of the -st module
- test classes: src/test/java of the -st module
- name client interfaces after the resource with "Client" suffix (e.g., GreetingsResource -> GreetingsResourceClient)
- RegisterRestClient configKey: "service_uri"
- STs end with "IT" suffix
- do not use RestAssured. Write e2e test in the -st module

## JAX-RS
- resources should be named in plural (e.g., SpeakersResource not SpeakerResource)
- @Consumes and @Produces should be declared on class-level
- do not implement business logic in JAX-RS resources; delegate to a use case
- prefer returning JAX-RS Response over JsonObject in resources
- do not create new "@RegisterRestClient(configKey," - reuse existing
- JAX-RS-bound types (`FileUpload`, `@RestForm`, `@PartType`) live only in `adapter.in.rest`; they never appear in use-case or port signatures

## JSON Serialization
- use JSON-P for dynamic or polymorphic JSON structures where explicit control over the output is needed
- use JSON-B for typed records and DTOs that map 1:1 to their JSON representation — automatic binding avoids boilerplate
- record entities with dynamic structure should ship with toJSON method returning a JSON-P object
- always map JSON-P in the boundary to entities
- create record entities from JSON-P JsonObject in static method: fromJSON(JsonObject json)

## HTTP Client
- for external REST-shaped services, prefer a MicroProfile/Quarkus REST Client interface (`@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "...")`) over hand-rolled HTTP calls; reuse an existing configKey rather than minting a new one
- fall back to `java.net.http.HttpClient` (synchronous) only for one-off calls that don't fit the REST Client interface shape
- use asynchronous Http APIs (HttpClient.sendAsync) only if explicitly requested

## Project Management
- always ask before changing build.gradle
- on opening existing projects, load AGENTS.md (if present) before making changes
- do not create or change any files on opening existing projects; stop after initialization and wait for instructions
- do not generate code initially in an empty project
- gradle build.gradle must not be created for Java 25 CLI applications
- use quarkus-hibernate-validator for Jakarta Bean Validation when input validation would otherwise require repetitive manual checks
- create metrics and observability features with OTEL / opentelemetry
